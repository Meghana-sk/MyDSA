## Problem 1: Transpose Matrix
[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/transpose-matrix/description/)
Given a 2D integer array matrix, return the transpose of matrix.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]
Example 2:

Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]

## Problem 2: Matrix diagonal sum
[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/matrix-diagonal-sum/description/)

Given a square matrix mat, return the sum of the matrix diagonals.

Only include the sum of all the elements on the primary diagonal and all the elements on the secondary diagonal that are not part of the primary diagonal.

 
Example 1:


Input: mat = [[1,2,3],
              [4,5,6],
              [7,8,9]]
Output: 25
Explanation: Diagonals sum: 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25
Notice that element mat[1][1] = 5 is counted only once.
Example 2:

Input: mat = [[1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1]]
Output: 8
Example 3:

Input: mat = [[5]]
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

n == mat.length == mat[i].length
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= mat[i][j] <= 100


## Problem 3: Squares of a Sorted Array
[Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-of-a-sorted-array/description/)

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
